# We are the Champions

Do you want to say something positive to a person? Well, lucky for you, the "We are the Champions" web app allows you to do so. Simply type your message, write your name and who you want to address it to, and BAM!, you have written a compliment addressed your intended person on a message board. In addition to writing the message, you can also like it and delete it. (You have the option to like any message but delete only the ones you've written in that browser session.)

## My process

Make the MVP work before I get into the "Stretch Goals" and "My Additions". Additionally, work on a focus-by-focus process i.e. work on all things HTML, CSS, and JS related to the form section first, then do all the endorsement related content second.

### Built with

HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Firebase Realtime Database

### What I learned

When writing to an element's `innerHTML`, everytime it is overwritten, the event listeners previously associated with the elements in it will be removed.

### Useful resources
